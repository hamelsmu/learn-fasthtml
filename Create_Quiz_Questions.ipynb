      "In this chapter we are going to look deeper into the htmx toolkit. We‚Äôve accomplished quite a bit with what we‚Äôve learned so far. Still, when you are developing Hypermedia-Driven Applications, there will be times when you need to reach for additional options and techniques.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "We will go over the more advanced attributes in htmx, as well as expand on the advanced details of attributes we have already used.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Additionally, we will look at functionality that htmx offers beyond simple HTML attributes: how htmx extends standard HTTP request and responses, how htmx works with (and produces) events, and how to approach situations where there isn‚Äôt a simple, single target on the page to be updated.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Finally, we will take a look at practical considerations when doing htmx development: how to debug htmx-based applications effectively, security considerations you will need to take into account when working with htmx, and how to configure the behavior of htmx.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "With the features and techniques in this chapter, you will be able to pull off extremely sophisticated user interfaces using only htmx and perhaps a small bit of hypermedia-friendly client-side scripting.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "## Htmx Attributes\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Thus far we have used about fifteen different attributes from htmx in our application. The most important ones have been:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "`hx-get`, `hx-post`, etc.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "    \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "To specify the AJAX request an element should make\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "`hx-trigger`\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "    \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "To specify the event that triggers a request\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "`hx-swap`\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "    \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "To specify how to swap the returned HTML content into the DOM\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "`hx-target`\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "    \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "To specify where in the DOM to swap the returned HTML content\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Two of these attributes, `hx-swap` and `hx-trigger`, support a number of useful options for creating more advanced Hypermedia-Driven Applications.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "### hx-swap\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "We‚Äôll start with the hx-swap attribute. This is often not included on elements that issue htmx-driven requests because its default behavior ‚Äî `innerHTML`, which swaps the inner HTML of the element ‚Äî tends to cover most use cases.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "We earlier saw situations where we wanted to override the default behavior and use `outerHTML`, for example. And, in chapter 2, we discussed some other swap options beyond these two, `beforebegin`, `afterend`, etc.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In chapter 5, we also looked at the `swap` delay modifier for `hx-swap`, which allowed us to fade some content out before it was removed from the DOM.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In addition to these, `hx-swap` offers further control with the following modifiers:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "`settle`\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "    \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Like `swap`, this allows you to apply a specific delay between when the content has been swapped into the DOM and when its attributes are ‚Äúsettled‚Äù, that is, updated from their old values (if any) to their new values. This can give you fine-grained control over CSS transitions.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "`show`\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "    \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Allows you to specify an element that should be shown ‚Äî that is, scrolled into the viewport of the browser if necessary ‚Äî when a request is completed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "`scroll`\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "    \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Allows you to specify a scrollable element (that is, an element with scrollbars), that should be scrolled to the top or bottom when a request is completed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "`focus-scroll`\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "    \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Allows you to specify that htmx should scroll to the focused element when a request completes. The default for this modifier is ‚Äúfalse.‚Äù\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So, for example, if we had a button that issued a `GET` request, and we wished to scroll to the top of the `body` element when the request completed, we would write the following HTML:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "```\r\n",
      "<button hx-get=\"/contacts\" hx-target=\"#content-div\"\r\n",
      "  hx-swap=\"innerHTML show:body:top\"> <1>\r\n",
      "  Get Contacts\r\n",
      "</button>\r\n",
      "```\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Scrolling to the top of the page\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "  1. This tells htmx to show the top of the body after the swap occurs.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "More details and examples can be found online in the `hx-swap` documentation.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "### hx-trigger\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Like `hx-swap`, `hx-trigger` can often be omitted when you are using htmx, because the default behavior is typically what you want. Recall the default triggering events are determined by an element‚Äôs type:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "  * Requests on `input`, `textarea` & `select` elements are triggered by the `change` event.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "  * Requests on `form` elements are triggered on the `submit` event.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "  * Requests on all other elements are triggered by the `click` event.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There are times, however, when you want a more elaborate trigger specification. A classic example is the active search example we implemented in Contact.app:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "```\r\n",
      "<input id=\"search\" type=\"search\" name=\"q\"\r\n",
      "  value=\"{{ request.args.get('q') or '' }}\"\r\n",
      "  hx-get=\"/contacts\"\r\n",
      "  hx-trigger=\"search, keyup delay:200ms changed\"/> <1>\r\n",
      "```\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The active search input\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "  1. An elaborate trigger specification.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This example took advantage of two modifiers available for the `hx-trigger` attribute:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "`delay`\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "    \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Allows you to specify a delay to wait before a request is issued. If the event occurs again, the first event is discarded and the timer resets. This allows you to ‚Äúdebounce‚Äù requests.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "`changed`\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "    \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Allows you to specify that a request should only be issued when the `value` property of the given element has changed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "`hx-trigger` has several additional modifiers. This makes sense, because events are fairly complex and we want to be able to take advantage of all the power they offer. We will discuss events in more detail below.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Here are the other modifiers available on `hx-trigger`:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "`once`\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "    \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The given event will only trigger a request once.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "`throttle`\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "    \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Allows you to throttle events, only issuing them once every certain interval. This is different than `delay` in that the first event will trigger immediately, but any following events will not trigger until the throttle time period has elapsed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "`from`\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "    \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A CSS selector that allows you to pick another element to listen for events on. We will see an example of this used later in the chapter.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "`target`\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "    \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A CSS selector that allows you to filter events to only those that occur directly on a given element. In the DOM, events ‚Äúbubble‚Äù to their ancestor elements, so a `click` event on a button will also trigger a `click` event on an enclosing `div`, all the way up to the `body` element. Sometimes you want to specify an event directly on a given element, and this attribute allows you to do that.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "`consume`\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "    \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "If this option is set to `true`, the triggering event will be cancelled and not propagate to ancestor elements.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "`queue`\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "    \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This option allows you to specify how events are queued in htmx. By default, when htmx receives a triggering event, it will issue a request and start an event queue. If the request is still in flight when another event is received, it will queue the event and, when the request finishes, trigger a new request. By default, it only keeps the last event it receives, but you can modify that behavior using this option: for example, you can set it to `none` and ignore all triggering events that occur during a request.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "#### Trigger filters\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The `hx-trigger` attribute also allows you to specify a _filter_ for events by using square brackets enclosing a JavaScript expression after the event name.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Let‚Äôs say you have a complex situation where contacts should only be retrievable in certain situations. You have a JavaScript function, `contactRetrievalEnabled()` that returns a boolean, `true` if contacts can be retrieved and `false` otherwise. How could you use this function to place a gate on a button that issues a request to `/contacts`?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "To do this using an event filter in htmx, you would write the following HTML:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "```\r\n",
      "<script>\r\n",
      "  function contactRetrievalEnabled() {\r\n",
      "    // code to test if contact retrieval is enabled\r\n",
      "    ...\r\n",
      "  }\r\n",
      "</script>\r\n",
      "<button hx-get=\"/contacts\"\r\n",
      "  hx-trigger=\"click[contactRetrievalEnabled()]\"> <1>\r\n",
      "  Get Contacts\r\n",
      "</button>\r\n",
      "```\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The active search input\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "  1. A request is issued on click only when `contactRetrievalEnabled()` returns `true`.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The button will not issue a request if `contactRetrievalEnabled()` returns false, allowing you to dynamically control when the request will be made. There are common situations that call for an event trigger, when you only want to issue a request under specific circumstances:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "  * if a certain element has focus\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "  * if a given form is valid\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "  * if a set of inputs have specific values\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Using event filters, you can use whatever logic you‚Äôd like to filter requests by htmx.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "#### Synthetic events\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In addition to these modifiers, `hx-trigger` offers a few ‚Äúsynthetic‚Äù events, that is events that are not part of the regular DOM API. We have already seen `load` and `revealed` in our lazy loading and infinite scroll examples, but htmx also gives you an `intersect` event that triggers when an element intersects its a viewport.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This synthetic event uses the modern Intersection Observer API, which you can read more about at MDN.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Intersection gives you fine-grained control over exactly when a request should be triggered. For example, you can set a threshold and specify that the request be issued only when an element is 50% visible.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The `hx-trigger` attribute certainly is the most complex in htmx. More details and examples can be found in its documentation.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "### Other Attributes\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Htmx offers many other less commonly used attributes for fine-tuning the behavior of your Hypermedia-Driven Application.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Here are some of the most useful ones:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "hx-push-url\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "    \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "‚ÄúPushes‚Äù the request URL (or some other value) into the navigation bar.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "hx-preserve\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "    \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Preserves a bit of the DOM between requests; the original content will be kept, regardless of what is returned.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "hx-sync\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "    \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Synchronized requests between two or more elements.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "hx-disable\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "    \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Disables htmx behavior on this element and any children. We will come back to this when we discuss the topic of security.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Let‚Äôs take a look at `hx-sync`, which allows us to synchronize AJAX requests between two or more elements. Consider a simple case where we have two buttons that both target the same element on the screen:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "```\r\n",
      "<button hx-get=\"/contacts\" hx-target=\"body\">\r\n",
      "  Get Contacts\r\n",
      "</button>\r\n",
      "<button hx-get=\"/settings\" hx-target=\"body\">\r\n",
      "  Get Settings\r\n",
      "</button>\r\n",
      "```\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Two competing buttons\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This is fine and will work, but what if a user clicks the ‚ÄúGet Contacts‚Äù button and then the request takes a while to respond? And, in the meantime the user clicks the ‚ÄúGet Settings‚Äù button? In this case we would have two requests in flight at the same time.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "If the `/settings` request finished first and displayed the user‚Äôs setting information, they might be very surprised if they began making changes and then, suddenly, the `/contacts` request finished and replaced the entire body with the contacts instead!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "To deal with this situation, we might consider using an `hx-indicator` to alert the user that something is going on, making it less likely that they click the second button. But if we really want to guarantee that there is only one request at a time issued between these two buttons, the right thing to do is to use the `hx-sync` attribute. Let‚Äôs enclose both buttons in a `div` and eliminate the redundant `hx-target` specification by hoisting the attribute up to that `div`. We can then use `hx-sync` on that div to coordinate requests between the two buttons.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Here is our updated code:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "```\r\n",
      "<div hx-target=\"body\" <1>\r\n",
      "  hx-sync=\"this\"> <2>\r\n",
      "  <button hx-get=\"/contacts\">\r\n",
      "    Get Contacts\r\n",
      "  </button>\r\n",
      "  <button hx-get=\"/settings\">\r\n",
      "    Get Settings\r\n",
      "  </button>\r\n",
      "</div>\r\n",
      "```\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Syncing two buttons\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "  1. Hoist the duplicate `hx-target` attributes to the parent `div`.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "  2. Synchronize on the parent `div`.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "By placing the `hx-sync` attribute on the `div` with the value `this`, we are saying ‚ÄúSynchronize all htmx requests that occur within this `div` element with one another.‚Äù This means that if one button already has a request in flight, other buttons within the `div` will not issue requests until that has finished.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The `hx-sync` attribute supports a few different strategies that allow you to, for example, replace an existing request in flight, or queue requests with a particular queuing strategy. You can find complete documentation, as well as examples, at the htmx.org page for `hx-sync`.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As you can see, htmx offers a lot of attribute-driven functionality for more advanced Hypermedia-Driven Applications. A complete reference for all htmx attributes can be found on the htmx website.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "## Events\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Thus far we have worked with JavaScript events in htmx primarily via the `hx-trigger` attribute. This attribute has proven to be a powerful mechanism for driving our application using a declarative, HTML-friendly syntax.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "However, there is much more we can do with events. Events play a crucial role both in the extension of HTML as a hypermedia, and, as we‚Äôll see, in hypermedia-friendly scripting. Events are the ‚Äúglue‚Äù that brings the DOM, HTML, htmx and scripting together. You might think of the DOM as a sophisticated ‚Äúevent bus‚Äù for applications.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "We can‚Äôt emphasize enough: to build advanced Hypermedia-Driven Applications, it is worth the effort to learn about events in depth.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "### Htmx-Generated Events\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In addition to making it easy to _respond_ to events, htmx also _emits_ many useful events. You can use these events to add more functionality to your application, either via htmx itself, or by way of scripting.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Here are some of the most commonly used events triggered by htmx:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "`htmx:load`\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "    \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Triggered when new content is loaded into the DOM by htmx.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "`htmx:configRequest`\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "### Server Generated Events\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "We are going to talk more about the various ways that htmx enhances regular HTTP requests and responses in the next section, but, since it involves events, we are going to discuss one HTTP Response header that htmx supports: `HX-Trigger`. We have discussed before how HTTP requests and responses support _headers_ , name-value pairs that contain metadata about a given request or response. We took advantage of the `HX-Trigger` request header, which includes the id of the element that triggered a given request.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In addition to this _request header_ , htmx also supports a _response header_ also named `HX-Trigger`. This response header allows you to _trigger an event_ on the element that submitted an AJAX request. This turns out to be a powerful way to coordinate elements in the DOM in a decoupled manner.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "To see how this might work, let‚Äôs consider the following situation: we have a button that grabs new contacts from some remote system on the server. We will ignore the details of the server-side implementation, but we know that if we issue a `POST` to the `/sync` path, it will trigger a synchronization with the system.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now, this synchronization may or may not result in new contacts being created. In the case where new contacts _are_ created, we want to refresh our contacts table. In the case where no contacts are created, we don‚Äôt want to refresh the table.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "To implement this we could conditionally add an `HX-Trigger` response header with the value `contacts-updated`:\r\n",

      "@app.route('/sync', methods=[\"POST\"])\r\n",

      "  2. If any contacts were updated we conditionally trigger the `contacts-updated` event on the client\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This value would trigger the `contacts-updated` event on the button that made the AJAX request to `/sync`. We can then take advantage of the `from:` modifier of the `hx-trigger` attribute to listen for that event. With this pattern we can effectively trigger htmx requests from the server side.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Here is what the client-side code might look like:\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "  2. This table listens for the event and refreshes when it occurs\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The table listens for the `contacts-updated` event, and it does so on the `body` element. It listens on the `body` element since the event will bubble up from the button, and this allows us to not couple the button and table together: we can move the button and table around as we like and, via events, the behavior we want will continue to work fine. Additionally, we may want _other_ elements or requests to trigger the `contacts-updated` event, so this provides a general mechanism for refreshing the contacts table in our application.\r\n",

      "    \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Allows you to specify a new target to swap the response content into on the client side\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "You can find a reference for all requests and response headers in the htmx documentation.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "### HTTP Response Codes\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Even more important than response headers, in terms of information conveyed to the client, is the _HTTP Response Code_. We discussed HTTP Response Codes in Chapter 3. By and large htmx handles various response codes in the manner that you would expect: it swaps content for all 200-level response codes and does nothing for others. There are, however, two ‚Äúspecial‚Äù 200-level response codes:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "  * `204 No Content` \\- When htmx receives this response code, it will _not_ swap any content into the DOM (even if the response has a body)\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "  * `286` \\- When htmx receives this response code to a request that is polling, it will stop the polling\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "You can override the behavior of htmx with respect to response codes by, you guessed it, responding to an event! The `htmx:beforeSwap` event allows you to change the behavior of htmx with respect to various status codes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Let‚Äôs say that, rather than doing nothing when a `404` occurred, you wanted to alert the user that an error had occurred. To do so, you want to invoke a JavaScript method, `showNotFoundError()`. Let‚Äôs add some code to use the `htmx:beforeSwap` event to make this happen:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "```\r\n",
      "document.body.addEventListener('htmx:beforeSwap', evt => { <1>\r\n",
      "  if (evt.detail.xhr.status === 404) { <2>\r\n",
      "    showNotFoundError();\r\n",

      "  1. Hook into the `htmx:beforeSwap` event.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "  2. If the response code is a `404`, show the user a dialog.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "You can also use the `htmx:beforeSwap` event to configure if the response should be swapped into the DOM and what element the response should target. This gives you quite a bit of flexibility in choosing how you want to use HTTP Response codes in your application. Full documentation on the `htmx:beforeSwap` event can be found at htmx.org.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "## Updating Other Content\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Above we saw how to use a server-triggered event, via the `HX-Trigger` HTTP response header, to update a piece of the DOM based on the response to another part of the DOM. This technique addresses the general problem that comes up in Hypermedia-Driven Applications: ‚ÄúHow do I update other content?‚Äù After all, in normal HTTP requests, there is only one ‚Äútarget‚Äù, the entire screen, and, similarly, in htmx-based requests, there is only one target: either the explicit or implicit target of the element.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "If you want to update other content in htmx, you have a few options:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "### Expanding Your Selection\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The first option, and the simplest, is to ‚Äúexpand the target.‚Äù That is, rather than simply replacing a small part of the screen, expand the target of your htmx-driven request until it is large enough to enclose all the elements that need to be updated on a screen. This has the tremendous advantage of being simple and reliable. The downside is that it may not provide the user experience that you want, and it may not play well with a particular server-side template layout. Regardless, we always recommend at least thinking about this approach first.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "### Out of Band Swaps\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A second option, a bit more complex, is to take advantage of ‚ÄúOut Of Band‚Äù content support in htmx. When htmx receives a response, it will inspect it for top-level content that includes the `hx-swap-oob` attribute. That content will be removed from the response, so it will not be swapped into the DOM in the normal manner. Instead, it will be swapped in for the content that it matches by id.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Let‚Äôs look at an example. Consider the situation we had earlier, where a contacts table needs to be updated if an integration pulls down any new contacts. Previously we solved this by using events and a server-triggered event via the `HX-Trigger` response header.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This time, we‚Äôll use the `hx-swap-oob` attribute in the response to the `POST` to `/integrations/1`. The new contacts table content will ‚Äúpiggyback‚Äù on the response.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Next, the response to the `POST` to `/integrations/1` will include the content that needs to be swapped into the button, per the usual htmx mechanism. But it will also include a new, updated version of the contacts table, which will be marked as `hx-swap-oob=\"true\"`. This content will be removed from the response so that it is not inserted into the button. Instead, it is swapped into the DOM in place of the existing table since it has a matching id.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "```\r\n",
      "HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\n",

      "  2. This content will be removed from the response and swapped by id.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Using this piggybacking technique, you can update content wherever needed on a page. The `hx-swap-oob` attribute supports other additional features, all of which are documented.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Depending on how exactly your server-side templating technology works, and what level of interactivity your application requires, out of band swapping can be a powerful mechanism for content updates.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "### Events\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Finally, the most complex mechanism for updating content is the one we saw back in the events section: using server-triggered events to update elements. This approach can be very clean, but also requires a deeper conceptual knowledge of HTML and events, and a commitment to the event-driven approach. While we like this style of development, it isn‚Äôt for everyone. We typically recommend this pattern only if the htmx philosophy of event-driven hypermedia really speaks to you.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "If it _does_ speak to you, however, we say: go for it. We‚Äôve created some very complex and flexible user interfaces using this approach, and we are quite fond of it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "### Being Pragmatic\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "All of these approaches to the ‚ÄúUpdating Other Content‚Äù problem will work, and will often work well. However, there may come a point where it would just be simpler to use a different approach for your UI, like the reactive one. As much as we like the hypermedia approach, the reality is that there are some UX patterns that simply cannot be implemented easily using it. The canonical example of this sort of pattern, which we have mentioned before, is something like a live online spreadsheet: it is simply too complex a user interface, with too many interdependencies, to be done well via exchanges of hypermedia with a server.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In cases like this, and any time you feel like an htmx-based solution is proving to be more complex than another approach might be, we recommend that you consider a different technology. Be pragmatic, and use the right tool for the job. You can always use htmx for the parts of your application that aren‚Äôt as complex and don‚Äôt need the full complexity of a reactive framework, and save that complexity budget for the parts that do.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "We encourage you to learn many different web technologies, with an eye to the strengths and weaknesses of each one. This will give you a deep tool chest to reach into when problems present themselves. Our experience is that, with htmx, hypermedia is a tool you can reach for frequently.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "## Debugging\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "We are not ashamed to admit: we are big fans of events. They are the underlying technology of almost any interesting user interface, and are particularly useful in the DOM once they have been unlocked for general use in HTML. They let you build nicely decoupled software while often preserving the locality of behavior we like so much.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "However, events are not perfect. One area where events can be particularly tricky to deal with is _debugging_ : you often want to know why an event _isn‚Äôt_ happening. But where can you set a break point for something that _isn‚Äôt_ happening? The answer, as of right now, is: you can‚Äôt.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "The first technique, provided by htmx itself, is to call the `htmx.logAll()` method. When you do this, htmx will log all the internal events that occur as it goes about its business, loading up content, responding to events and so forth.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Not exactly easy on the eyes, is it?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But, if you take a deep breath and squint, you can see that it isn‚Äôt _that_ bad: a series of htmx events, some of which we have seen before (there‚Äôs `htmx:configRequest`!), get logged to the console, along with the element they are triggered on.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "After a bit of reading and filtering, you will be able to make sense of the event stream, and it can help you debug htmx-related issues.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "### Monitoring Events in Chrome\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The preceding technique is useful if the problem is occurring somewhere _within_ htmx, but what if htmx is never getting triggered at all? This comes up some times, like when, for example, you have accidentally typed an event name incorrectly somewhere.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In cases like this you will need recourse to a tool available in the browser itself. Fortunately, the Chrome browser by Google provides a very useful function, `monitorEvents()`, that allows you to monitor _all_ events that are triggered on an element.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This feature is available _only_ in the console, so you can‚Äôt use it in code on your page. But, if you are working with htmx in Chrome, and are curious why an event isn‚Äôt triggering on an element, you can open the developers console and type the following:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "```\r\n",
      "monitorEvents(document.getElementById(\"some-element\"));\r\n",
      "```\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Htmx logs\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This will then print _all_ the events that are triggered on the element with the id `some-element` to the console. This can be very useful for understanding exactly which events you want to respond to with htmx, or troubleshooting why an expected event isn‚Äôt occurring.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Using these two techniques will help you as you (infrequently, we hope) troubleshoot event-related issues when developing with htmx.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "## Security Considerations\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In general, htmx and hypermedia tends to be more secure than JavaScript heavy approaches to building web applications. This is because, by moving much of the processing to the back end, the hypermedia approach tends not to expose as much surface area of your system to end users for manipulation and shenanigans.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "However, even with hypermedia, there are still situations that require care when doing development. Of particular concern are situations where user-generated content is shown to other users: a clever user might try to insert htmx code that tricks the other users into clicking on content that triggers actions they don‚Äôt want to take.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In general, all user-generated content should be escaped on the server-side, and most server-side rendering frameworks provide functionality for handling this situation. But there is always a risk that something slips through the cracks.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In order to help you sleep better at night, htmx provides the `hx-disable` attribute. When this attribute is placed on an element, all htmx attributes within that element will be ignored.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "### Content Security Policies & Htmx\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A Content Security Policy (CSP) is a browser technology that allows you to detect and prevent certain types of content injection-based attacks. A full discussion of CSPs is beyond the scope of this book, but we refer you to the Mozilla Developer Network article on the topic for more information.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A common feature to disable using a CSP is the `eval()` feature of JavaScript, which allows you to evaluate arbitrary JavaScript code from a string. This has proven to be a security issue and many teams have decided that it is not worth the risk to keep it enabled in their web applications.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Htmx does not make heavy use of `eval()` and, thus, a CSP with this restriction in place will be fine. The one feature that does rely on `eval()` is event filters, discussed above. If you decide to disable `eval()` for your web application, you will not be able to use the event filtering syntax.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "## Configuring\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There are a large number of configuration options available for htmx. Some examples of things you can configure are:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "  * The default swap style\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "  * The default swap delay\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "  * The default timeout of AJAX requests\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A full list of configuration options can be found in the config section of the main htmx documentation.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Htmx is typically configured via a `meta` tag, found in the header of a page. The name of the meta tag should be `htmx-config`, and the content attribute should contain the configuration overrides, formatted as JSON. Here is an example:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "```\r\n",
      "<meta name=\"htmx-config\" content='{\"defaultSwapStyle\":\"outerHTML\"}'>\r\n",
      "```\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "An htmx configuration via `meta` tag\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In this case, we are overriding the default swap style from the usual `innerHTML` to `outerHTML`. This might be useful if you find yourself using `outerHTML` more frequently than `innerHTML` and want to avoid having to explicitly set that swap value throughout your application.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "## HTML Notes: Semantic HTML\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Telling people to ‚Äúuse semantic HTML‚Äù instead of ‚Äúread the spec‚Äù has led to a lot of people guessing at the meaning of tags ‚Äî ‚Äúlooks pretty semantic to me!‚Äù ‚Äî instead of engaging with the spec.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "> I think being asked to write _meaningful_ HTML better lights the path to realizing that it isn‚Äôt about what the text means to humans‚Äî‚Äãit‚Äôs about using tags for the purpose outlined in the specs to meet the needs of software like browsers, assistive technologies, and search engines.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "https://t-ravis.com/post/doc/semantic_the_8_letter_s-word/\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "We recommend talking about, and writing, _conformant_ HTML. (We can always bikeshed further). Use the elements to the full extent provided by the HTML specification, and let the software take from it whatever meaning they can.\r\n",
